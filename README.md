### Let me do a brief introduction! ðŸ¤“

I jumped from research in biology into data in healthcare.   Some years later, I found Data Science.
And here I am.  I will attempt to lay out a landscape of my repos and what you can expect to find.

ðŸ“š Documented Learning ðŸ“š
- [1Q2022-DataCamp-1CourseperDay-Challenge](https://github.com/elena-e-barbulescu/1Q2022-DataCamp-1CourseperDay-Challenge) - Took on a challenge in early 2022 to refresh my foundations.  You'll find all the courses I did, their respective repos, and also links to my Linkedin progression posts.

ðŸŒ± Currently working on ðŸŒ±
- [data-engineering-zoomcamp-2023](https://github.com/elena-e-barbulescu/data-engineering-zoomcamp-2023) - Learning some bits and pieces of this zoomcamp for micro upskilling.   I took a stab at this in 2022 [Data-Engineering-Zoomcamp-2022](https://github.com/elena-e-barbulescu/Data-Engineering-ZoomCamp-2022). While I did not finish due to time constraints, I did learn something new.
