### Let me do a brief introduction! ðŸ¤“

Before I dive into the details of this Github repo, I want to mention that I am an active writer on Linkedin and you'll find more information about me if you visit my profile.   

- âš¡ My [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbulescuelena/)

Addtionally, I now have a website of my own where I have showcased details about my data science projects and collaborations, my overall experience, skills, mindset, and other events such as honorary mentions and publications.

Now... for the formal introduction.

I jumped from research in biology into data in healthcare.   Some years later, I found Data Science.
And here I am.  I will attempt to lay out a landscape of my repos and what you can expect to find.

ðŸ“š Documented Learning ðŸ“š
- [1Q2022-DataCamp-1CourseperDay-Challenge](https://github.com/elena-e-barbulescu/1Q2022-DataCamp-1CourseperDay-Challenge) - Took on a challenge in early 2022 to refresh my foundations.  You'll find all the courses I did, their respective repos, and also links to my Linkedin progression posts.
